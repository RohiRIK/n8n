## Overview

**Why build this?**  
Microsoft's Copilot for Security is expensive, closed-source, and often doesn’t fit the real-life workflows or integrations needed by modern SOC teams. It’s slow to adapt, performs generic triage, and cannot be fully customized or hosted locally—creating limitations on both privacy and cost.

## The Alternative: Custom SOC Automation

This project introduces a fully customizable, locally hosted automation flow for security operations (SOC). Instead of relying on heavy and pricey cloud services, you get a transparent system, designed for real analyst workflows and maximum flexibility.

## Core Principles

- **Local Control:** Host everything on-prem or in your own secure cloud. You own all rules, logic, and data.
- **Custom Triage & Decisions:** Every step—from initial alert to executive decision—can be tuned for your environment and threat landscape.
- **Open Integration:** Connect to any data source, enrichment tool, or workflow app (SIEM, Notion, internal APIs) freely.
- **Cost Efficiency:** No recurring SaaS fees. Free to scale and upgrade. Invest in your team’s knowledge, not vendor lock-in.

## Key Features

- **Tiered Agent Workflow:** Mimics a real SOC—Tier 1 for intake/triage, Tier 2 for investigation/enrichment, SOC Lead for final decisions.
- **Rule & AI Driven:** Use fast heuristics, smart prompts, or connect advanced LLMs locally for agentic analysis.
- **Full Observability:** Structured outputs, sessionId chain, and full evidence/context at every decision. Easy to audit.
- **Enrichment on Demand:** Integrate tools like SearXNG, irecrawl, or your own threat intel—no vendor restrictions.
- **Flexible Design:** Easily tune steps, prompts, and escalation logic as your SOC matures.

## Why it’s better

- Private: No risk of leaking data to cloud LLM providers.
- Adaptable: Add your own playbooks, enrichment, and decision logic on the fly.
- Transparent: Full view of every input, output, and step. No “black box” magic.
- Scalable: No licensing limits or nickel-and-dime pricing for every alert.

## Use Cases

- Rapid alert triage for detection teams
- Automated enrichment and context gathering for incident response
- Streamlined escalation with clear triggers and full case history
- Real-time SOC reporting and knowledge sharing

## Get Started

Clone the workflow, customize your agent prompts and enrichment logic, and hook up your data sources. Fine-tune for your own risk, compliance, and business needs—no more “one-size-fits-all” security automation.
