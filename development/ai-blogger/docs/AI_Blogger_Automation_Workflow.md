### Key Considerations

- **Central Control:** The Publisher maintains control and is the final authority on when a post is ready to go live.
- **Iterative Feedback:** Allow for multiple rounds of feedback and revision until the Publisher deems the content satisfactory.
- **Communication:** Ensure clear channels for agents to promptly address feedback and make necessary revisions.

This streamlined process ensures high-quality content that meets both linguistic standards and factual accuracy, while allowing the Publisher to effectively manage and direct the final approval and publication stages.
